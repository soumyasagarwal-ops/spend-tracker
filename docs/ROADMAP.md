## Now & Next — current priorities

| Priority | Item |
|---|---|
| 🔴 P0 | **Bulk-categorize queue** — clear the ~72% uncategorized fast |
| 🔴 P0 | **Merchant normalization** — collapse brand variants (`SWIGGY` / `SWIGGY LTD` / `SWIGGY INSTAMART` → one merchant) |
| 🟠 P1 | **"Big purchases" strip** — surface large one-off payments that need a human label |
| 🟠 P1 | **Committed-monthly-outflow** number — subscriptions + SIPs |
| 🟢 | **Replace Income page with a Wallet view** (see note under Shipped) |
| 🟢 | **Net-worth / investments-growth view** |

## Shipped

### v1.0 — Foundation ✅

Core ingestion, categorization, and visualization.

- [x] FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy + SQLite
- [x] HDFC, ICICI, and generic CSV parsers
- [x] XLSX/XLS parser (openpyxl / xlrd)
- [x] PDF parser (pdfplumber)
- [x] Keyword-based auto-categorization engine
- [x] File watcher — drop-and-ingest from `backend/data/watched_folder/`
- [x] Manual upload via drag-and-drop modal
- [x] Two-level deduplication (file hash + row hash)
- [x] React frontend with Tailwind CSS + Recharts
- [x] Spend time-series charts (day / week / month / year)
- [x] Category donut chart
- [x] Summary KPI strip (daily spend, spend txns, top category)
- [x] Date range filtering (Month / Last Month / 30 Days / Year / All)
- [x] Transactions table with category + type filters
- [x] Demo mode — synthetic data for portfolio sharing
- [x] Insights panel — plain-English spending observations

### Since v1.0 — Wallet model, classification & richer analytics ✅

- [x] **Wallet model** — Loaded / Invested / Spent / Unspent buckets (`/analytics/wallet`)
- [x] **Smart classification flags** — `is_internal_transfer` (self top-ups) and `is_investment`, excluded from spend
- [x] **Spending velocity** — per-week spend + week-over-week % change
- [x] **Top merchant list** — aggregate spend by payee, with count + avg/txn
- [x] **Recurring transaction detection** — auto-tagged subscriptions/EMIs + next-due estimate
- [x] **Day-of-week heatmap** — spend by day-of-week × week-of-month
- [x] **Custom date range** — picker pre-filled with and clamped to real data bounds
- [x] **Category management UI** — add / rename / delete categories, colour picker, edit keyword rules
- [x] **Manual re-categorization** — inline category change per transaction row
- [x] **Income page** — sources, regularity, expected-vs-actual, savings trajectory

> ⚠️ **Income page note:** it shipped, but for a salary-funded *spending wallet*
> these income/savings metrics are largely not meaningful (real income lands in the
> salary account). It is slated to be **replaced by a Wallet view** — see Now & Next.

## Later

### Categorization (continues the P0 work)
- [ ] **Uncategorized queue** — dedicated view of all unmatched transactions for review
- [ ] **Bulk re-categorization** — select multiple transactions → assign category
- [ ] **Category merge** — combine two categories and re-tag history
- [ ] **Category drill-down** — click a category in the donut → see its transactions
- [ ] **Month-over-month change badges** — "+12% vs last month" on KPI cards

### Multi-account & multi-bank
- [x] **Inter-account transfer detection** — shipped as `is_internal_transfer` (self-transfers)
- [ ] **Account model** — link each imported file to a named account
- [ ] **Account selector** — filter all views by account
- [ ] **Cross-account net-worth snapshot** — needs balance data in statements
- [ ] **New bank parsers** — Axis, Kotak, SBI, Yes Bank, Paytm, PhonePe

### Data export & sharing
- [ ] **CSV export** — download filtered transactions
- [ ] **PDF report** — monthly summary with charts + KPI table
- [ ] **Shareable dashboard link** — time-limited public link showing demo data only
- [ ] **JSON API export** — machine-readable export of all transactions

### Intelligence layer (v2.0)
- [ ] **Anomaly detection** — flag unusually large / out-of-pattern transactions
- [ ] **Spend forecast** — project next month's spend by category
- [ ] **Natural language query** — "How much did I spend on food in March?"
- [ ] **LLM-assisted categorization** — for ambiguous UPI/individual descriptions
- [ ] **Tax-relevant tagging** — flag business expenses / 80C-eligible investments

### Infrastructure & quality
- [ ] **Docker Compose** — single `docker compose up` for the full stack
- [ ] **PostgreSQL option** — swap SQLite for hosted / multi-user deployments
- [ ] **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions: pytest + ESLint + type-check on every PR
- [ ] **API versioning** — `/api/v1/` prefix for non-breaking evolution
- [ ] **OpenAPI-generated frontend client** — typed client from the FastAPI schema
- [ ] **End-to-end tests** — Playwright golden path (upload → categorize → dashboard)
- [ ] **Performance** — index `transactions(date, data_mode)` for large datasets (10k+ rows)

## Out of scope for this account type

The wallet model deliberately omits these — they don't apply to a salary-funded
spending wallet (see [DOCUMENTATION.md §2](DOCUMENTATION.md#2-the-wallet-model-core-concept)):

- **Monthly budgets per category** & over-budget alerts (former v1.4)
- **Savings-rate / savings-goal** tracking
- **Income as a first-class model** (former v1.2) — superseded by the Wallet view

## Ideas Backlog (not yet scheduled)

Candidates for future versions; priority depends on user feedback.

- Mobile-responsive layout improvements
- Dark mode
- Recurring bill tracker ("Netflix due on the 15th")
- WhatsApp / SMS transaction parsing
- UPI transaction tagging (Google Pay, PhonePe breakdowns)
- Year-in-review annual summary view
- Multiple currency support
- Family / shared finance view with per-member tagging
