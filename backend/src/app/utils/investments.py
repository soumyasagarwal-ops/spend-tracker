"""Detect investment outflows — money moved into broking / mutual-fund / SIP
platforms. On a spending wallet these are wealth, not consumption, so they must
be separated from the spend total (otherwise a single ₹84k Grip transfer looks
like a spending blowout).

Two signals:
1. A broking UPI handle — VPAs from broking platforms carry a ".BRK@" segment,
   e.g. GRIPBROKING.CF.BRK@VALIDHDFC, INDSTOCKS.ICCL1.BRK@VALIDHDFC
2. A known investment-platform name in the description.
